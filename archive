Syntax:
# + \n marks the beginning of a section

# marks the chat where the text came from.
It is followed by the first chat of the concept, without space.

Each break in the chat is marked by the origin chat

[...] means that a piece of the message was deleted.
Because it had nothing to do with the subject.

Every section has a tag, that takes the first letter of each word, and makes it
into an acronym.
if two sections have the same acronym... expand the second word
like: ONWFT -> ONamesWFT


TODO BFS make this paragraph understandable, its so confusing XD

# On Names With Falling Tone.

"In (NAM.1) and (NAM.2), the name after mi carries a falling tone. It can also
carry any other tone. The name ends automatically when the phrase started by
the name's tone ends."

I'm actually a little confused about this phrasing
oh, phrase means something very specific, right

(mỉ {no ní})
{λ𝑋 chua(‹no ní›, 𝑋)}().

Hỏemāı10/07/2018
So here the names are "bũ" and "nèo ní"
An adverbial phrase and a prepositional phrase
the prepositional phrase ends with its noun complement (which itself ends once
its serial verb is over and once there aren't any attached relative clauses
anymore)
And then the name is automatically over

Lıq10/07/2018
so, if my name is Lı̉q, that tone is part of the name? as in, mi Líq and mi Lĩq are different persons

Hỏemāı10/07/2018
Unless you also go by those names

Lıq10/07/2018
right

m̂, fragments of terms and serial predicates also can be taken as a name/phrase by mi/shu

Anyhow normally you will find a name in the fourth tone
[...]

# Summary.
Names can have any tone.
But the most common one (up till now) is the fourth tone (?).
Two names with the same word but different tones are different names.
    mi Lı̉q <> mi Líq <> mi Lĩq
So, you can be named line verb, or an adverb, or a noun! YOU DECIDE!!

# On Frames and Signatures

As for frames-list.txt...

Since there are only a few common types in the type system 
    (c, 0, 1, and 2),
and since each word has usually only one or two slots, it happens that a lot of
words have the same signature as each other.

(This is bolstered by the fact that Toaq tries to build patterns into the
vocabulary, so many words that deal with similar concepts are given them same
signature on purpose.
-- see the triplet 
    (dua, chi, miu) 
or 
    (jui, jao, leaq, poe, cuao) )

A frame is just a common signature that lots of words fit into.
For example, the LEO frame is the signature
    [(c) (c 1)] -- 
predicates whose 1-ary meaning takes just a concrete object and whose 2-ary
meaning takes a concrete object and a property (a proposition with one open
slot)

Math stuff here, don't look if you're already feeling overwhelmed :smiley: : There's also the special case of the JEO frame, which has the signature [(0) (c 1)] and the special requirement that, for a predicate P to be in the JEO frame, it must satisfy the equivalence P(x, y) = P(jeo(x, y)).  We also have the MAO frame, which is defined as predicates which have a signature of [(0) (c 1)] but which don't satisfy that equality, which is named the "JEO-frame Equivalence"
