# On Names With Falling Tone.

"In (NAM.1) and (NAM.2), the name after mi carries a falling tone. It can also
carry any other tone. The name ends automatically when the phrase started by
the name's tone ends."

I'm actually a little confused about this phrasing
oh, phrase means something very specific, right

(mỉ {no ní})
{λ𝑋 chua(‹no ní›, 𝑋)}().

Hỏemāı10/07/2018
So here the names are "bũ" and "nèo ní"
An adverbial phrase and a prepositional phrase
the prepositional phrase ends with its noun complement (which itself ends once
its serial verb is over and once there aren't any attached relative clauses
anymore)
And then the name is automatically over

Lıq10/07/2018
so, if my name is Lı̉q, that tone is part of the name? as in, mi Líq and mi Lĩq are different persons

Hỏemāı10/07/2018
Unless you also go by those names

Lıq10/07/2018
right

m̂, fragments of terms and serial predicates also can be taken as a name/phrase by mi/shu

[...]
Anyhow normally you will find a name in the fourth tone
[...]

# Summary.
Names can have any tone.
But the most common one (up till now) is the fourth tone (?).
Two names with the same word but different tones are different names.
    mi Lı̉q <> mi Líq <> mi Lĩq
So, you can be named line verb, or an adverb, or a noun! YOU DECIDE!!
