# Toaq Resources

Toaq learning resources. Links, tutorials, and TODOs.

This is a collection of resources for the Toaq language. Every link mentioned in
the Discord chat, explanations for common concepts, usage guides for the bots,
community guidelines, advice, and TODOs.

The point here is to have an open place to discuss how to make Toaq easy to
learn, so feel free to clone and modify the repository, and add whatever you
think can help. We are very open and permissive to additions.
