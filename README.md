# Toaq Resources

Toaq learning resources. Links, tutorials, and TODOs.

This is a collection of resources for the Toaq language. Every link mentioned in
the Discord chat, explanations for common concepts, usage guides for the bots,
community guidelines, advice, and TODOs.

The point here is to have an open place to discuss how to make Toaq easy to
learn, so feel free to clone and modify the repository, and add whatever you
think can help. We are very open and permissive to additions.

On the Bots.

There is a #test-2 channel, we suggest you do any experiments with the
bots there. So as to not crowd the other channels.

There are 4 bots:
    nuogai
    Septapus
    SOA
    Telegram

Nuogai is uakci's child.
You can see its help with %help

SOA is solpahi's child.
You can see its help with !help
