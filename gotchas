#1 argument order
The dictionary and the official documentation shows the definitions like this:
    mai
        __ loves __

You would think that the usage of the word would be like this:
    Subject mai Object,
    jip mai sub

But it is actually like this:
    mai Subject Object,
    mai jip sub

Verb Subject Object is the standard in the chat.

P.D
if you don't find jip in the dictionary, its because its in vieotoaq.
look it up in the links page.
