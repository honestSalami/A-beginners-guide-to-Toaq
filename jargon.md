UoD, UofD:

    Universe of Discourse.
    The set of things under discussion at a given time.

DWIM:

    Do What I Mean
    Interpret what I said with the intention I had.
    "To be free to be interpreted in the intended way."

contentive:

    That carries content – predicate, i.e., root word or compound word.

JEO-frame Equivalence:

    See [archive](https://github.com/toaq/resources/blob/master/archive.md), On frames and signatures.

predicate:

    Verb – a word that relates a number of arguments.

Proposition:


property:
    For example, the sentence "chu?q ja do/ ma/oja-"
    is like a template statement, with a single hole for a noun.
    Equivalent to the lambda expression:
        lambda x: x eats the banana

    

grammar:

    The rules that parsers use to deconstruct the sentences.
    Different parsers use slightly different grammars, which might result in different parses (although wider discrepancies can be found in semantics).

signature notation:

    c, 0, 1, … is a notation used to describe the "signature" of a predicate.
    It tells you what kind of thing each place should be filled with, and, more importantly, how it behaves in a serial predicate.

    c = "concrete." "c" doesn't subordinate.
    0 = predication (a rising-falling tone (â) phrase, or lû phrase, without the lambda quantifier (ja))
    1 = a property (with exactly one ja in it)
    2 = a relation (with two ja)

    For example, we can describe a predicate like dua as (c 0) –
    the first place is concrete, the second place is a predication.
