# Notation systems

## Signature Notation

c, 0, 1,  is a notation to describe the "signature" of a predicate.
It tells you what kind of thing each place is.

c = "concrete"
0 = predication (a rising-falling tone :t5: phrase without any ja in it)
1 = a property with exactly one ja in it, i.e., a lambda function
2 = same, but with two ja (two lambda variables)

So we can describe a predicate like dua as (c 0)
the first place is concrete, the second place is a predication

This matters for serial predicates, because how they combine depends on the
signature of their component predicates

TODO 
examples of the notation with 20 words of different kinds
    (I like overkill)
