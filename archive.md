### Summary
Names can have any tone, but the most common one is the fourth tone.
Two names with the same word, but different tones are technically different names (mı Lỉq <> mı Líq <> mı Lĩq).

> Math stuff here, don't look if you're already feeling overwhelmed :smiley: : There's also the special case of the JEO frame, which has the signature [(0) (c 1)] and the special requirement that, for a predicate P to be in the JEO frame, it must satisfy the equivalence P(x, y) = P(jeo(x, y)).  We also have the MAO frame, which is defined as predicates which have a signature of [(0) (c 1)] but which don't satisfy that equality, which is named the "JEO-frame Equivalence"
