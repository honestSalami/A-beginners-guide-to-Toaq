## On names with falling tone

### Summary
Names can have any tone, but the most common one is the fourth tone.
Two names with the same word, but different tones are technically different names (mı Lỉq <> mı Líq <> mı Lĩq).

## On frames and signatures 

This file contains most of the common frames.    
[frames-list.txt](https://github.com/acotis/serial-predicate-engine/blob/master/code/dict/frame-list.txt)

> As for frames-list.txt...
> Since there are only a few common types in the type system 
>     (c, 0, 1, and 2),
> and since each word has usually only one or two slots, it happens that a lot of
> words have the same signature as each other.
> 
> (This is bolstered by the fact that Toaq tries to build patterns into the
> vocabulary, so many words that deal with similar concepts are given them same
> signature on purpose.

>     (jui, jao, leaq, poe, cuao) )
> 
> A frame is just a common signature that lots of words fit into.
> For example, the LEO frame is the signature
>     [(c) (c 1)] -- 
> predicates whose 1-ary meaning takes just a concrete object and whose 2-ary
> meaning takes a concrete object and a property (a proposition with one open
> slot)
> 
> Math stuff here, don't look if you're already feeling overwhelmed :smiley: : There's also the special case of the JEO frame, which has the signature [(0) (c 1)] and the special requirement that, for a predicate P to be in the JEO frame, it must satisfy the equivalence P(x, y) = P(jeo(x, y)).  We also have the MAO frame, which is defined as predicates which have a signature of [(0) (c 1)] but which don't satisfy that equality, which is named the "JEO-frame Equivalence"

## On ternary predicates

nuogaiBOT
> 1–1/1 — cutaq + — <▯1, ▯2> are such that <x1, x2, x1> satisfy ternary relation ▯/3; ▯ does/is ▯/3 to themselves.

> Here's one that was added recently

> It's the first one I know of though
>
> 2-ary properties are useful for words like mia (___ satisfies property ___ with many things) and jeq (___ and ___ satisfy property ___ with the same thing)
> 3-ary properties aren't useful for much, as far as we've discovered


## On the low tone

### 2019-03-13, #general
mi Hỏaqgīo
> Here's how :t6: works:
> Both :t6: and :t7: serve to create adverbials. An adverbial is a part of a sentence that makes a claim about the sentence itself (not its text, but its content).
>
> Everything in Toaq is done with predicates, and adverbials are no different. Ultimately an adverbial always does its thing by taking the entire Toaq sentence, pretending is has a :t5: tone (that generates propositions) and sticking it into the first place of a predicate.
>
> For example:
>
> "Shie jí rào kôi hó"
>
> Here, the rao with the :t6: grabs the entire rest of the sentence, throws it into a :t5: clause, then passes it as the x1 place to the predicate rao.  :t6: also has the effect of taking the following noun and passing it to the predicate as the x2 place.
>
> Thus the sentence is equivalent to:
>
> "Rao (shîe jí na) kôi hó"
>
> With the originally top-level claim in parentheses
>
> It means "I am awake while he/she is walking"

## On the necessity of the tones

### 2019-03-13, #general
mi Hỏaqgīo
> :t6: and :t7: can be excluded without too much difficulty
>
> :t3: might be possible to get rid of, but it would take some work to prove that. It doesn't just expand to something else like those other two tones do
>
> :t1:, :t2:, :t4:, :t5:, and :t8: are all 100% necessary
